# ANOVA
**ANOVA**, which stands for **Analysis of Variance**, is a statistical method used to determine whether there are statistically significant differences between the means of three or more groups. Unlike the t-test, which examines whether there is a difference between two groups, ANOVA is used to assess differences among multiple group means simultaneously by comparing the variances within each group to the variances between the groups. The primary goal of ANOVA is to determine whether any of those differences are statistically significant.

## Types of ANOVA

## One-Way ANOVA

One-Way ANOVA is a statistical method used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups. Unlike the t-test, which compares the means of two groups, One-Way ANOVA can handle multiple groups simultaneously, making it a powerful tool for analyzing variations within and between groups.

The key concepts of the One-Way ANOVA includes: 
- Factor: The independent variable that categorizes the data. In One-Way ANOVA, there is only one factor.
- Levels: The different categories or groups within the factor.
- Dependent Variable: The outcome or response variable that is measured.
- Null Hypothesis (H~0~): Assumes that all group means are equal.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H~1~): Assumes that at least one group mean is different.

### When to Use One-Way ANOVA
One-Way ANOVA is appropriate when you want to:

- Compare the means of three or more independent groups.
- Assess the impact of a single categorical factor on a continuous dependent variable.
- Determine if at least one group mean significantly differs from the others.


### Assumptions of One-Way ANOVA
Before performing One-Way ANOVA, ensure that your data meet the following assumptions:

- Independence of Observations: The samples are independent of each other.
- Normality: The data in each group are approximately normally distributed.
- Homogeneity of Variances: The variance among the groups should be approximately equal.


### Approach
At its core, ANOVA partitions the total variance in the data into components attributable to different sources. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **Hypothesis Definition**
    - **Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \))**: All group means are equal.
    - **Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_a \))**: At least one group mean is different.

2. **Sum of Squares (SS)**

    1. **Total Sum of Squares (SS Total)**

        ???+ defi "Definition: SS Total"
            Measure of the total variability in the data

            \[
            SS_{Total} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - \overline{Y})^2
            \]

            with: 

            - \( Y_i \) = individual observations  
            - \( \overline{Y} \) = grand mean
            - \( N \) = total number of observations  

    2. **Between-Group Sum of Squares (SS Between)**

        ???+ defi "Definition: SS Between"
            Measure of the variability due to the factor (e.g., different treatments).

            \[
            SS_{Between} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j (\overline{Y}_j - \overline{Y})^2
            \]
            
            with:

            - \( \overline{Y}_j \) = mean of group \( j \)  
            - \( n_j \) = number of observations in group \( j \)
            - \( k \) = number of groups  

    3. **Within-Group Sum of Squares (SS Within)**

        ???+ defi "Definition: SS Between"

            Measure of the variability within each group.

            \[
            SS_{Within} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (Y_{ij} - \overline{Y}_j)^2
            \]

3. **Degrees of Freedom (df)**

    ???+ defi "Definition: Degree of Freedom"

        \[
        df_{Total} = N-1 \quad | \quad df_{Between} = k-1 \quad | \quad df_{Within} = N-k
        \]

        with:

        - \( N \) = total number of observations  
        - \( k \) = number of groups 

4. **Mean Squares (MS)**

    ???+ defi "Definition: Mean Squares"
        \[
        MS_{Between} = \frac{SS_{Between}}{df_{Between}} \quad | \quad MS_{Within} =  \frac{SS_{Within}}{df_{Within}}
        \]

5. **F-Statistic**

    ???+ defi "Definition: ANOVA F-Statistic"
        \[
        F = \frac{MS_{Between}}{MS_{Within}}
        \]

    **Interpretation**: A higher F-value indicates greater evidence against the null hypothesis. The p-value is derived from the F-distribution and determines the statistical significance of the results.

    **Constructing the ANOVA Table**

    | Source of Variation | Sum of Squares (SS) | Degrees of Freedom (df) | Mean Square (MS) | F-Statistic | p-Value |
    |---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------|---------|
    | Between Groups      | \( SS_{Between} \)  | \( k - 1 \)             | \( MS_{Between} \)| \( F \)     |         |
    | Within Groups       | \( SS_{Within} \)   | \( N - k \)             | \( MS_{Within} \) |             |         |
    | **Total**           | \( SS_{Total} \)    | \( N - 1 \)             |                  |             |         |


6. **Interpretation of Results**
    As we have have seen before in the T-Test and F-Test, if the p-value is smaller than \( \alpha\) (commonly 0.05) we reject H~0~. If \(p> \alpha\) we fail to reject \( H_0 \).

    If the ANOVA is significant, determine which specific groups differ using post-hoc tests like the **Tukey HSD** test to control for multiple comparisons.


???+ example "Example One-Way ANOVA in Production Scenario"

    Letâ€™s consider a realistic production scenario. A factory uses three different machines (Machine A, Machine B, and Machine C) to assemble electronic components. The production manager wants to know if the machine type affects the assembly time.

    ```

        - **Calculate Group Means**:
            ```py 
            k = 3

            SSB = len(A)*(Y_mean_A - Y_mean)**2 + len(B)*(Y_mean_B - Y_mean)**2 + len(C)*(Y_mean_C - Y_mean)**2
            print(f"Sum of Squares Between Groups: {SSB}")

            # Calculate Sum of Squares Within Groups

            SSW = sum((np.array(A) - Y_mean_A)**2) + sum((np.array(B) - Y_mean_B)**2) + sum((np.array(C) - Y_mean_C)**2)
            print(f"Sum of Squares Within Groups: {SSW}")

            # Calculate Sum of Squares Total

            SST = SSB + SSW
            print(f"Sum of Squares Total: {SST}")
            ```

            ```title=">>> Output"

            print(f"df Between Groups: {df_B}")
            print(f"df Within Groups: {df_W}")
            print(f"df Total: {df_T}")

        - **F-Statistic**
            ```py 
            # F-Statistic

            F = MSB / MSW
            print(f"F-Statistic: {F}")
            ```

            ```title=">>> Output"
            F-Statistic: 53.1
            ```

        ---

        - **Determine p-Value**
            Using an F-distribution table or statistical software with \( df_1 = df_{Between} = 2 \) and \( df_2 = df_{Within} = 12 \), an F-value of 53.1 is highly significant (p < 0.001).

    ???+ example "Automatic Calculation"
        For calculation the p-value and the f-statistics of the ANOVA we can use the 'f_oneway' method of the 'scipy.stats' library: 

        ```py 
        from scipy.stats import f_oneway

        f,p = f_oneway(A, B, C)

        print(f"F-Statistic: {f}")
        print(f"P-Value: {p}")
        ```

        ```title=">>> Output"

        P-Value: 1.0959316602384747e-06
        ```

    ---

    - **Interpretation**

        Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. There are significant differences in production times among the three machines.

    ---

    - **Post-Hoc Analysis**
        To identify which specific machines differ we can perform a **Tukey HSD Test** revealing that:

        ```py 
        from scipy.stats import tukey_hsd

        tukey_results = tukey_hsd(A,B,C)
        print(tukey_results)
        ```

        ```title=">>> Output"

        (2 - 1)     -6.800     0.000    -8.570    -5.030
        ```

        - Machine A vs. Machine B: Significant difference
        - Machine A vs. Machine C: Significant difference
        - Machine B vs. Machine C: Significant difference
    
    ---

    - **Conclusion**: All three machines have significantly different production times, with Machine B (`Y_mean_A = 17.6`) being the slowest and Machine C (`Y_mean_A = 10.8`) being the fastest.

# One-Way ANOVA Explained with a Production Example

## Introduction to One-Way ANOVA

**One-Way Analysis of Variance (One-Way ANOVA)** is a statistical method used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups. Unlike the t-test, which compares the means of two groups, One-Way ANOVA can handle multiple groups simultaneously, making it a powerful tool for analyzing variations within and between groups.

## Key Concepts

- **Factor**: The independent variable that categorizes the data. In One-Way ANOVA, there is only one factor.
- **Levels**: The different categories or groups within the factor.
- **Dependent Variable**: The outcome or response variable that is measured.
- **Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \))**: Assumes that all group means are equal.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_a \))**: Assumes that at least one group mean is different.

## When to Use One-Way ANOVA

One-Way ANOVA is appropriate when you want to:
- Compare the means of three or more independent groups.
- Assess the impact of a single categorical factor on a continuous dependent variable.
- Determine if at least one group mean significantly differs from the others.

## Assumptions of One-Way ANOVA

Before performing One-Way ANOVA, ensure that your data meet the following assumptions:
1. **Independence of Observations**: The samples are independent of each other.
2. **Normality**: The data in each group are approximately normally distributed.
3. **Homogeneity of Variances**: The variance among the groups should be approximately equal.

## One-Way ANOVA in Production: A Practical Example

### Scenario

A manufacturing company produces widgets using three different machines (Machine A, Machine B, and Machine C). The company wants to determine if there is a significant difference in the production time (in minutes) among the three machines.

### Research Question

*Does the type of machine used affect the production time of widgets?*

### Variables

- **Factor**: Machine Type
  - **Levels**: Machine A, Machine B, Machine C
- **Dependent Variable**: Production Time (minutes)

### Data Collection

Suppose the company records the production times for 10 widgets from each machine:

| Widget | Machine A | Machine B | Machine C |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1      | 12        | 15        | 14        |
| 2      | 11        | 16        | 13        |
| 3      | 13        | 14        | 15        |
| 4      | 12        | 15        | 14        |
| 5      | 11        | 16        | 13        |
| 6      | 13        | 14        | 15        |
| 7      | 12        | 15        | 14        |
| 8      | 11        | 16        | 13        |
| 9      | 13        | 14        | 15        |
| 10     | 12        | 15        | 14        |

### Performing One-Way ANOVA

#### Step 1: State the Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \))**: \( \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C \)
  
  *(The mean production times for all machines are equal.)*

- **Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_a \))**: At least one \( \mu \) is different.
  
  *(At least one machine has a different mean production time.)*

#### Step 2: Calculate Group Means and Grand Mean

- **Machine A Mean (\( \overline{Y}_A \))**: \( (12 + 11 + 13 + 12 + 11 + 13 + 12 + 11 + 13 + 12) / 10 = 12 \) minutes
- **Machine B Mean (\( \overline{Y}_B \))**: \( (15 + 16 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 14 + 15) / 10 = 15.5 \) minutes
- **Machine C Mean (\( \overline{Y}_C \))**: \( (14 + 13 + 15 + 14 + 13 + 15 + 14 + 13 + 15 + 14) / 10 = 14.5 \) minutes
- **Grand Mean (\( \overline{Y} \))**: \( (12 + 15 + 14 + 12 + 11 + 16 + 13 + 12 + 15 + 14 + 11 + 16 + 13 + 13 + 14 + 12 + 15 + 14 + 13 + 15 + 12 + 15 + 14 + 11 + 16 + 13 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 12 + 15 + 14 + 13 + 15 + 14) / 30 = 14 \) minutes

#### Step 3: Calculate Sum of Squares

1. **Total Sum of Squares (SS Total)**:
   \[
   SS_{Total} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - \overline{Y})^2 =  \sum (Y_i - 14)^2 =  (12-14)^2 + (11-14)^2 + \ldots + (13-14)^2 + (15-14)^2 + (14-14)^2 =  2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + 1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 = 60
   \]

2. **Between-Group Sum of Squares (SS Between)**:
   \[
   SS_{Between} = n (\overline{Y}_A - \overline{Y})^2 + n (\overline{Y}_B - \overline{Y})^2 + n (\overline{Y}_C - \overline{Y})^2 = 10(12-14)^2 + 10(15.5-14)^2 + 10(14.5-14)^2 = 10(4) + 10(2.25) + 10(0.25) = 40 + 22.5 + 2.5 = 65
   \]

3. **Within-Group Sum of Squares (SS Within)**:
   \[
   SS_{Within} = SS_{Total} - SS_{Between} = 60 - 65 = -5
   \]
   
   *(Note: In practice, SS Within should not be negative. This discrepancy suggests an error in calculations. Ensure accurate computations when performing ANOVA.)*

#### Step 4: Calculate Degrees of Freedom

- **df Total**: \( N - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 \)
- **df Between**: \( k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
- **df Within**: \( N - k = 30 - 3 = 27 \)

#### Step 5: Calculate Mean Squares

- **Mean Square Between (MS Between)**:
  \[
  MS_{Between} = \frac{SS_{Between}}{df_{Between}} = \frac{65}{2} = 32.5
  \]

- **Mean Square Within (MS Within)**:
  \[
  MS_{Within} = \frac{SS_{Within}}{df_{Within}} = \frac{-5}{27} \approx -0.185
  \]
  
  *(Again, SS Within should not be negative. Recheck calculations for accuracy.)*

#### Step 6: Calculate F-Statistic

\[
F = \frac{MS_{Between}}{MS_{Within}} = \frac{32.5}{-0.185} \approx -175.68
\]

*(A negative F-value is not possible in ANOVA, indicating calculation errors. Ensure correct computation of sum of squares.)*

### Corrected Example

To avoid confusion, let's provide a corrected and simplified example with accurate calculations.

#### Corrected Data

| Machine | Production Time (minutes) |
|---------|---------------------------|
| A       | 12, 11, 13, 12, 11, 13, 12, 11, 13, 12 |
| B       | 15, 16, 14, 15, 16, 14, 15, 16, 14, 15 |
| C       | 14, 13, 15, 14, 13, 15, 14, 13, 15, 14 |

#### Correct Calculations

1. **Group Means**:
   - \( \overline{Y}_A = 12 \)
   - \( \overline{Y}_B = 15.5 \)
   - \( \overline{Y}_C = 14.5 \)
   - \( \overline{Y} = 14 \)

2. **SS Total**:
   \[
   SS_{Total} = \sum (Y_i - 14)^2 = (12-14)^2 \times 10 + (15-14)^2 \times 10 + (14-14)^2 \times 10 = 4 \times 10 + 1 \times 10 + 0 \times 10 = 40 + 10 + 0 = 50
   \]

3. **SS Between**:
   \[
   SS_{Between} = 10(12-14)^2 + 10(15.5-14)^2 + 10(14.5-14)^2 = 10(4) + 10(2.25) + 10(0.25) = 40 + 22.5 + 2.5 = 65
   \]

4. **SS Within**:
   \[
   SS_{Within} = SS_{Total} - SS_{Between} = 50 - 65 = -15
   \]
   
   *(This still results in a negative SS Within, indicating an inconsistency. To ensure a correct example, let's adjust the data slightly.)*

#### Final Corrected Example

Let's adjust the group means to ensure \( SS_{Total} \geq SS_{Between} \).

| Machine | Production Time (minutes) |
|---------|---------------------------|
| A       | 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14 |
| B       | 15, 16, 15, 15, 16, 15, 16, 15, 15, 16 |
| C       | 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13 |

Now:

- \( \overline{Y}_A = 14 \)
- \( \overline{Y}_B = 15.5 \)
- \( \overline{Y}_C = 13 \)
- \( \overline{Y} = 14 \)

1. **SS Total**:
   \[
   SS_{Total} = \sum (Y_i - 14)^2 = 0 \times 10 + 1.5^2 \times 10 + (-1)^2 \times 10 = 0 + 22.5 + 10 = 32.5
   \]

2. **SS Between**:
   \[
   SS_{Between} = 10(14-14)^2 + 10(15.5-14)^2 + 10(13-14)^2 = 0 + 10(2.25) + 10(1) = 0 + 22.5 + 10 = 32.5
   \]

3. **SS Within**:
   \[
   SS_{Within} = SS_{Total} - SS_{Between} = 32.5 - 32.5 = 0
   \]
   
   *(Perfect homogeneity within groups, unlikely in real scenarios but valid for illustrative purposes.)*

4. **Degrees of Freedom**:
   - **df Total**: \( 30 - 1 = 29 \)
   - **df Between**: \( 3 - 1 = 2 \)
   - **df Within**: \( 30 - 3 = 27 \)

5. **Mean Squares**:
   - **MS Between**: \( \frac{32.5}{2} = 16.25 \)
   - **MS Within**: \( \frac{0}{27} = 0 \)

6. **F-Statistic**:
   \[
   F = \frac{MS_{Between}}{MS_{Within}} = \frac{16.25}{0} \rightarrow \infty
   \]
   
   *(An infinite F-value indicates a perfect separation between groups, which is theoretical. In practice, \( SS_{Within} \) is rarely zero.)*

### Interpretation

In this example, the F-statistic is extremely high (theoretically infinite), and the p-value would be much less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05). This leads to rejecting the null hypothesis, concluding that there are significant differences in production times among the three machines.

## Conclusion

One-Way ANOVA is an essential statistical tool for comparing the means of three or more independent groups. In production settings, it helps managers and engineers determine if different machines, processes, or conditions lead to significant variations in outcomes such as production time, quality, or efficiency. By adhering to ANOVA assumptions and following a systematic analysis process, organizations can make informed decisions to optimize their operations.

**Remember**:
- Always check ANOVA assumptions before proceeding.
- Use post-hoc tests like Tukey HSD to pinpoint specific group differences.
- Visualize your data to enhance understanding and interpretation of results.

By mastering One-Way ANOVA, you can effectively analyze and interpret complex data, leading to improved decision-making and operational efficiency in production environments.

### Key Concepts

- **Variance**: A measure of how much values in a dataset differ from the mean.
- **Factors**: Independent variables that are manipulated or categorized in the experiment.
- **Levels**: The different values or categories within a factor.
- **Dependent Variable**: The outcome variable that is measured in the experiment.

## When to Use ANOVA

ANOVA is appropriate in the following scenarios:

- **Comparing Multiple Groups**: When you have three or more groups to compare.
- **Categorical Independent Variables**: When your independent variables are categorical (e.g., treatment types, different age groups).
- **Continuous Dependent Variable**: When your dependent variable is continuous (e.g., test scores, weight loss).

### Example Scenario

Imagine a nutritionist wants to compare the effectiveness of three different diets (Diet A, Diet B, Diet C) on weight loss. Here, the diet type is the independent variable with three levels, and weight loss is the continuous dependent variable.


## Setting Up an ANOVA Analysis

To perform an ANOVA, follow these four steps:

1. **Review Experiment Design**
      - Ensure ANOVA is the appropriate method.
    - Check if your design involves categorical independent variables and a continuous dependent variable.

2. **Identify Variables**
    - **Independent Variables (Factors)**: The categories or groups you are comparing.
    - **Dependent Variable**: The outcome you are measuring.

3. **Create a Table of Factors and Levels**
    - Organize your factors and their corresponding levels.
   
4. **Compute the ANOVA Model and Interpret Results**
    - Calculate the variances and construct the ANOVA table.
    - Analyze the F-statistic and p-values to determine significance.

### Example Setup

**Research Goal**: Determine the effect of study duration (1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours) on exam performance.

- **Factor**: Study Duration
    - **Levels**: 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours
- **Dependent Variable**: Exam Score

## ANOVA Assumptions

ANOVA relies on several key assumptions:

1. **Independence of Observations**
    - Data points are independent of each other.

2. **Normality**
    - The data within each group should be approximately normally distributed.

3. **Homogeneity of Variances**
    - The variance among the groups should be approximately equal.

### Checking Assumptions

- **Independence**: Ensure the study design maintains independence (e.g., different participants in each group).
- **Normality**: Use graphical methods (e.g., Q-Q plots) or statistical tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test).
- **Homogeneity of Variances**: Apply tests like Leveneâ€™s Test or Bartlettâ€™s Test.

## The Mathematics of ANOVA

At its core, ANOVA partitions the total variance in the data into components attributable to different sources. Here's a simplified breakdown:

### Sum of Squares (SS)

1. **Total Sum of Squares (SS Total)**
    - Measures the total variability in the data.
    - Formula:  
     \[
     SS_{Total} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - \overline{Y})^2
     \]
    - \( Y_i \) = individual observations  
    - \( \overline{Y} \) = grand mean

2. **Between-Group Sum of Squares (SS Between)**
    - Measures variability due to the factor (e.g., different diets).
    - Formula:  
     \[
     SS_{Between} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j (\overline{Y}_j - \overline{Y})^2
     \]
    - \( \overline{Y}_j \) = mean of group \( j \)  
    - \( n_j \) = number of observations in group \( j \)

3. **Within-Group Sum of Squares (SS Within)**
    - Measures variability within each group.
    - Formula:  
     \[
     SS_{Within} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (Y_{ij} - \overline{Y}_j)^2
     \]

### Degrees of Freedom (df)

- **df Total**: \( N - 1 \)
- **df Between**: \( k - 1 \)
- **df Within**: \( N - k \)

### Mean Squares (MS)

- **MS Between**: \( \frac{SS_{Between}}{df_{Between}} \)
- **MS Within**: \( \frac{SS_{Within}}{df_{Within}} \)

### F-Statistic

- **Formula**:  
  \[
  F = \frac{MS_{Between}}{MS_{Within}}
  \]
- **Interpretation**: A higher F-value indicates greater evidence against the null hypothesis.

## Constructing the ANOVA Table

| Source of Variation | Sum of Squares (SS) | Degrees of Freedom (df) | Mean Square (MS) | F-Statistic | p-Value |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| Between Groups      | \( SS_{Between} \)  | \( k - 1 \)             | \( MS_{Between} \)| \( F \)     |         |
| Within Groups       | \( SS_{Within} \)   | \( N - k \)             | \( MS_{Within} \) |             |         |
| **Total**           | \( SS_{Total} \)    | \( N - 1 \)             |                  |             |         |

**Note**: The p-value is derived from the F-distribution and determines the statistical significance of the results.

## Interpretation of Results

### Null and Alternative Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \))**: All group means are equal.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_a \))**: At least one group mean is different.

### Decision Rule

- If **p-value < Î±** (commonly 0.05), reject \( H_0 \).
- If **p-value â‰¥ Î±**, fail to reject \( H_0 \).

### Post-Hoc Tests

If ANOVA is significant, determine which specific groups differ using post-hoc tests like the **Tukey HSD** test to control for multiple comparisons.

### Example Interpretation

**Scenario**: A one-way ANOVA is conducted to assess the effect of three teaching methods on student performance.

| Source           | SS    | df | MS    | F    | p-Value |
|------------------|-------|----|-------|------|---------|
| Between Groups   | 45.6  | 2  | 22.8  | 5.67 | 0.004   |
| Within Groups    | 180.9 | 27 | 6.70  |      |         |
| **Total**        | 226.5 | 29 |       |      |         |

- **F(2,27) = 5.67**, **p = 0.004**  
  Since p < 0.05, reject \( H_0 \). There is a significant difference in student performance among the teaching methods.
  
- **Post-Hoc Analysis**: Tukey HSD reveals that Teaching Method 1 significantly outperforms Teaching Method 3, while Teaching Method 2 shows no significant difference from the other methods.

## Interaction Effects in Two-Way ANOVA

In a **Two-Way ANOVA**, interaction effects occur when the effect of one factor depends on the level of another factor.

### Example Scenario

**Research Goal**: Examine the effects of diet type (Diet A, Diet B) and exercise frequency (Low, High) on weight loss.

- **Factors**:
  - **Diet Type**: Diet A, Diet B
  - **Exercise Frequency**: Low, High
- **Dependent Variable**: Weight Loss

### Interaction Interpretation

- **No Interaction**: The effect of diet type on weight loss is consistent regardless of exercise frequency.
- **Significant Interaction**: The effectiveness of diet types varies depending on the exercise frequency.

### Visualizing Interaction
