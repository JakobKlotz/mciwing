# Hypothesis and Metrics

## (In)dependent Variables
Let's begin with the basic concepts of independent variables (IVs) and dependent variables (DVs). 

- The dependent variable is what you're aiming to explain or predict in your study (the target). 
- The independent variables are the factors you believe will influence or cause changes in the dependent variable (the features).

In experimental research, independent variables are what you manipulate or control to observe their effect on the dependent variable. For example, if you're studying the effect of water on a plant, the amount of water is the independent variable, and the size or number of leaves are the dependent variable. 

???+ Controlable Variables
    Not all independent variables are under your control; some are observed variables that you believe have an impact on the dependent variable.

Let's explore a few examples.

???+ example "Examples: IV/DV Easy" 
    1. *The effect of sleep duration on cognitive function.*
        - **IV**: Sleep duration—it's what you might manipulate or measure to see its effect.
        - **DV**: Cognitive function—the outcome you're trying to explain or predict.

    2. *The relationship between socioeconomic status and health outcomes.*
        - **IV**: Socioeconomic status—it potentially influences health outcomes.
        - **DV**: Health outcomes—the aspect you're studying in relation to socioeconomic status.

    3. *Does the amount of screen time affect children's attention spans?*
        - **IV**: Amount of screen time - this is the variable you might adjust or observe.
        - **DV**: Children's attention spans - the outcome you're assessing.


In some cases, distinguishing between the IV and DV can be ambiguous. For instance:
???+ example "Examples: IV/DV Difficult" 
    *The correlation between stress levels and physical activity.*

    It's not immediately clear which variable influences the other. Does increased stress lead to less physical activity, or does less physical activity contribute to higher stress levels? Depending on your research focus, you might assign stress levels as the IV and physical activity as the DV, or vice versa.
