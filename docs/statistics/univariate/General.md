# General information 

This chapter introduces the fundamental statistical methods that are essential for effectively representing, describing, and analyzing univariate data. Univariate means that only a single feature, attribute, or variable is being considered. For example, this could refer to analyzing just a personâ€™s height or their income. It covers key topics such as **frequency distribution**, the concepts of **population and sample**, **measures of central tendency**, and **measures of dispersion**. These concepts form the basis for understanding how to summarize and interpret data in a meaningful way.

Some formulas differ between samples and populations (e.g., variance), which may result in slight variations in the calculations. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, the following sections will present the formulas for the entire population.
