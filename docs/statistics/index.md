This chapter introduces the fundamental statistical methods that are essential for effectively representing, describing, and analyzing univariate data. Univariate means that only a single feature, attribute, or variable is being considered. For example, this could refer to analyzing just a person’s height or their income. It covers key topics such as **frequency distribution**, the concepts of **population and sample**, **measures of central tendency**, and **measures of dispersion**. These concepts form the basis for understanding how to summarize and interpret data in a meaningful way.

Some formulas differ between samples and populations (e.g., variance), which may result in slight variations in the calculations. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, the following sections will present the formulas for the entire population.

In many applications, there is an interest not only in individual characteristics but also in multiple features. This chapter introduces the fundamental statistical methods for appropriately processing and graphically representing bivariate data. The topics covered include **frequency distribution** (contingency table, conditional frequencies) and **measures of correlation**. Bivariate analysis means that exactly two characteristics, attributes, or variables are considered. For example, it can explore the relationship between educational level and unemployment.

So far, we have focused on describing a dataset. Since samples are random, all statistical measures are also considered random variables. If we want to draw conclusions about the entire population, we must take this randomness into account. In this section, we will explore key concepts such as random variables, the central limit theorem, the law of large numbers, as well as the normal distribution and confidence intervals. In descriptive statistics, results pertain to the specific dataset at hand, whereas in inferential statistics, we make inferences about the broader population based on a sample.
