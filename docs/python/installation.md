# Installation

First, we need to install Python. You can download the latest version of Python
from the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

We recommend to install the latest version of `Python` (as of September 
2024, the latest version is `3.12.6`).

Depending on your operating system, the installation process may vary slightly.
Below, we will cover the installation process on a Windows machine. If you are
using **macOS**, python.org offers a corresponding installer (64-bit). 

## :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows

Execute the downloaded file (installer). When installing Python, make sure that
you check the box `Add python.exe to PATH`.

</div>

After the successful installation, we recommend to open a command prompt
(use the Windows search with the keyword `cmd`) and verify the installation by 
typing 

```commandline
python --version.
```

Which should result in:

```commandline
C:\Users\myuser>python --version
Python 3.12.6
```
