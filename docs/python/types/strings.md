# Strings

So far, we have already stored some text in a variable. For example 
`#!python "Hello World!"` which is called a string. A string is a primitive data
type. Integer, float, boolean and None are also primitive data types which we 
will cover later.

A string is simply a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered
a string in `Python`, and you can use single (`#!python '`) or double 
quotes (`#!python "`)
around your strings like this:

```py
text = "This is a string."
another_text = 'This is also a string.'
```

This flexibility allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your strings:

```py
text = "One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community."
print(text)
```

```py
text = 'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'
print(text)
```

## `type()`

Let's check the type of the variable `text`.

```py
text = "The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."
print(type(text))
```

which results in:

```
<class 'str'>
```

`#!python type()` comes in handy to check the type of variables. In this 
case, we can verify that `text` is indeed a string. Just like 
`#!python print()`, `#!python type()` 
is an important tool in your programming arsenal.

    It is advisable to consistently enclose your strings with either single 
    `#!python '...'` or double quotes `#!python "..."`. This will make your 
    code easier to read and maintain.

## String methods

One of the simplest string manipulation, is to change the case of 
the words in a string.

```py hl_lines="2"
name = "ash ketchum"  # famous Pok√©mon trainer ;-)
print(name.title())
```

```py
Ash Ketchum
```
