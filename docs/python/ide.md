# IDE

After the successful installation of Python, we use an IDE
(=Integrated Development Environment) which is simply put, a place to write and 
execute `Python` code. There are many IDEs available, but we recommend using 
[Visual Studio Code (VS Code/VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Visual Studio Code

### General Information

<!-- Following sections were copied from Manuels PyGuide -->

VSC is a *free, open-source* code editor developed by Microsoft :fontawesome-brands-windows:.
It has gained immense popularity among developers for its versatility and
extensive extension ecosystem, making it a powerful tool for various 
programming tasks, including Python and Jupyter Notebook programming. 
Some key features of VSC include:

- Cross-Platform: VSC is available for Windows :fontawesome-brands-windows:,
macOS :fontawesome-brands-apple:, and Linux :fontawesome-brands-linux:, 
making it accessible to developers on different operating systems.
- Lightweight: Itâ€™s known for its speed and efficiency. VSCode launches quickly
and consumes minimal system resources.
- Extensible: VSC supports a wide range of programming languages and 
technologies through extensions. You can customize the editor with extensions 
to add new features, integrations, and tools. VSCode offers intelligent code 
completion and suggestions, which can significantly boost your productivity 
while writing code. Additionally, there is an extension for GitHub
Copilot which gives you real-time AI-based suggestions (free for students;
sign-up [here](https://github.com/education/students))
- Version Control: It has built-in `Git` support, making it easy to manage 
version control and collaborate with others using Git repositories.
- Large Community: VSC has a large and active community, which means you can
find plenty of resources, extensions, and tutorials to enhance your coding
experience.

### Setup

Download the installer from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
The installation is straightforward, so we won't cover it in detail. 

#### Extensions

As already mentioned, VSC can be used for a wide range of programming
languages. To do this, we need to install the corresponding extensions. 
Therefore, start VSC and click on the sidebar on `Extensions`. Then search 
and install `Jupyter` and `Python` (both from Microsoft).
