# Definition of Key Terms

**Johannes Kepler** (1571-1630) is often considered one of the first **Data Scientists** due to his groundbreaking work in analyzing astronomical data to uncover the laws governing planetary motion. In the early 1600s, Kepler meticulously studied large amounts of observational data gathered by the astronomer Tycho Brahe. By applying mathematical models and repeated analysis, Kepler discovered that planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun, challenging the long-standing belief in circular orbits. His findings were published in the **Rudolphine Tables** in 1627, which were the most precise planetary position tables of the time. These tables, based on Kepler's laws of planetary motion, were crucial for navigation and scientific research for over a century, illustrating his innovative use of data to revolutionize our understanding of the solar system. This work laid the foundation for modern data analysis practices.

In the world of data analysis and processing, terms like **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Business Intelligence (BI)**, **Predictive Analytics**, and **Data Engineering** are often used. Each of these terms refers to distinct but interconnected fields and methods. To gain a better understanding of these areas, it is important to clearly define these terms and explore how they are related.
