# Data Basics
Before starting with Data Science, it's essential to **get to know the data** you'll be working with. This means thoroughly examining the attributes and values to understand their characteristics. Real-world data is often messy, large, and diverse, which can make it difficult to handle. For example, data from sensors might include missing or corrupted values, while social media data might be unstructured and include text, images, or even videos. In financial data, outliers or extreme values may skew analysis results.

Having a deep understanding of the data is crucial for successful data preprocessing, which is the first major step after acquiring the data. For instance, in sensor data, you may need to filter noise, while in social media data, you might need to convert unstructured text into a structured format for analysis. The main objective is to gather useful insights about the data, which will aid in the preprocessing stage, such as identifying patterns, missing values, or outliers. Grasping these aspects early on provides a solid foundation for the rest of your data analysis process.

## Dataset, Objects, Attributes
In order to do that, we need to distinguish between the terms data set, object and attribute:

- **Data Set**: A data set is a collection of related data organized in a structured format. It consists of multiple objects, each described by a set of attributes. A data set can be represented as a table, where each row corresponds to a data object and each column corresponds to an attribute. Data sets are commonly used in data analysis, machine learning, and other data-driven tasks, serving as the primary source of input for these processes.
- **Object**: An object (or sometimes records, instances, or entries) is an individual unit of data within a data set. It represents a single entity or instance, such as a person, a product, or an event, depending on the context of the data. Each data object is characterized by a set of attributes, which define its specific properties or features. In a tabular data set, a data object corresponds to a row, with each attribute value for that object stored in the respective columns.
- **Attributes**: Attributes (or sometimes variable, field, dimension, feature or observations) are the characteristics or properties that describe data objects in a data set. Each attribute represents a specific feature of the data object and is associated with a particular value. For example, in a data set of customer information, attributes might include "Name," "Age," "Gender," and "Purchase History." In a tabular representation, attributes are typically the column headers, with each column containing the attribute values for the corresponding data objects (rows). Attributes can be of different types as described later.
